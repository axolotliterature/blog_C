# blog_C
Basic blogging system made for an Intro to C course

Written entirely in C, this program allows users to create, count, search, print, and delete blog entries over a simple text-based UI.
The purpose of this program is to demonstrate an understanding of dynamic memory allocation in combination with creation, traversal, and removal of structs within linked lists without memory leaks or data loss. Writing this program has been a learning experience not only for an introduction into advanced data structures but also into debugging more difficult logic errors, such as munmap pointer errors and addressing memory leaks.
